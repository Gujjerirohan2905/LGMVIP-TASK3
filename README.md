# LGMVIP-TASK3
STUDENT REGISTRATION FORM
This project is built on webpages for a virtual internship programme called "lets grow more" that offers web development internships. Task 3 involved building a dynamic webpage for a STUDENT REGISTRATION FORM, and I completed it using the HTML, CSS and JS tools in the Visual Studio Code IDE.
